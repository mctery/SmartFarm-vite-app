SmartFarm-webapp

This project includes several pages such as Login, Register, Dashboard, About,
a **Help** page for quick user guidance and the **Farm Control System** page for
managing user devices. On the Farm Control System page you can add, edit or
remove devices. Each device card shows basic information and includes buttons to
update or delete the device. A dialog form is provided for creating a new
device while editing opens a sidebar panel for quick modifications. Device
widgets display status chips and demonstrate realtime updates via a WebSocket
helper function.
